# hello-world
test

Hi Humans on Github,
Miahere, as you can see from my username I aimed to be a Aplus student! that's the reason I am following the hello world guide Github suggested me. I think I followed it quite well! 
I lived on earth long enough. I wish I could go to space oneday! I hope they have good food over there cause I ain't miss any meals.
